# Java-Generics

Generic Method: Generic Java method takes a parameter and returns some value after performing a task. It is exactly like 
a normal function, however, a generic method has type parameters that are cited by actual type. This allows the generic 
method to be used in a more general way. The compiler takes care of the type of safety which enables programmers to 
code easily since they do not have to perform long, individual type castings.
